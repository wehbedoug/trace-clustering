== Overview

This repository demonstrates techniques for clustering simulation trajectories.

The trajectories in this example come from simulations of the the "NAV30"
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-24743-2_22[navigation benchmark].
Each trajectory starts in a grid cell at the top-left, and ends in
a grid cell at the bottom-right.

In the provided `small.pickle` dataset,
no two trajectories follow the same sequence of grid cells.
Furthermore, the trajectories may have differing lengths (i.e. unequal amounts
of data points), which can pose a challenge for
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error[mean squared error]
and other similarity metrics.

We consider several distance metrics for trajectory clustering. These metrics
are capable of comparing the similarity of two trajectories even when their
lengths differ. See `analyzer.py` for implementations.

. `hausdorff` – The
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance[Hausdorff distance]
between two traces is the furthest directed distance from any point in
either trace to its closest neighbor in the other trace.
//
We use the
`scipy` implementation of
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.directed_hausdorff.html[_directed_ Hausdorff distance]
in order to obtain the overall Hausdorff distance.
//
See equations (1) and (2) in
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7053955[this paper] for a
precise definition of (directed) Hausdorff distance.
+
In the example below, the furthest distance from $A$ to $B$ takes place at
the point $a_1$, so
$d_{AB} = \lVert a_1, \ b \rVert$.
//
However, the furthest distance from $B$ to $A$ is
$d_{BA} = \lVert b, \ a_2 \rVert$.
//
Since $d_{AB} > d_{BA}$, the overall Hausdorff distance is
+
`hausdorff(A, B) = hausdorff(B, A) = max(d_AB, d_BA) = d_AB`.

. `average` – Similar to above, we consider the distance from every point in
$A$ to its closest neighbor in $B$. However, we now take the average of all
the distances $A$ to $B$, and the average of all distances $B$ to $A$,
and return the average of the two averages. This lessens the effect of outliers,
which can greatly impact the Hausdorff distance.

. `frechet` – The
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_distance[Fréchet distance]
between two trajectories gives the "shortest leash" distance.
For trajectories with similar shapes but different speeds, the Fréchet distance
will consider the distance to be very small, making it ideal for spatial data
with a time component.
+
Informally, imagine you and a friend are hiking along two curved paths, and you
must each hold one end of a rope (or leash) connecting the two of you. Since
longer ropes are more expensive, you want to buy the shortest rope that is long
enough to do the job. You are both free to slow down or stop while the other
navigates tricky parts of the path, if it helps to keep the rope short. The
Fréchet distance is the length of the shortest rope that is sufficient for all
parts of the hike.
+
See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5pPVC-mw_I[this animation on YouTube]
for a visual representation. Note how the red line between the curves grows and
shrinks. The Fréchet distance is the maximum length of the red line.

. `area` (2-D only) – We use the
https://pypi.org/project/similaritymeasures/[similaritymeasures]
implementation of the area between 2-D curves as a metric for measuring their
similarity.


== Setup

TODO: Conda, requirements, etc.




== Customize

`main.py` contains several global constants at the top of the file that control
the input data, output location and file type, and plotting options. There is
also a constant that allows you to choose the amounts of clusters to consider.

In `analyzer.py`, the function `_choose_group_to_split` contains a choice of
which group of trajectories to split. By default, we split the group with the
largest intra-group distance; that is, the group containing the two most
"dissimilar" trajectories, according to the specified metric of similarity. If
desired, we can simply split the group with the most trajectories; this is
faster to compute, but may not be the "right" choice for trajectory clustering.




== Run the code

Ensure your conda environment is set up according to the instructions above.
Then, run the example with the following command:

[source, bash]
----
python main.py
----

If `SHOW_PLOT` is enabled, an interactive figure will be displayed for each
set of clustered trajectories.

If `SAVE_PLOT` is enabled, an image file will be created for each set of
clustered trajectories. You can configure the output directory and image file
type in `main.py`.
